    <p>
      Mozillians are people who volunteer their time to advance the Mozilla
      mission. They're dedicated to promoting openness, innovation and
      opportunity on the Web and they form the core of our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This directory is a resource to make it easy for Mozillians to learn who
      is involved, what they do and how to connect with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to find Mozillians in Auckland for a meetup? Need an expert XPCOM
      hacker to review a patch? That's exactly what this site is for.

    <h2>Privacy First</h2>

    <p>
      Privacy has been an important part of this directory from the very
      beginning. We want to make sure we provide Mozillians with the best
      experience possible, from the way the site is built to the way we vouch
      for new users before they can access data that should only be available
      to other Mozillians. Read our Privacy Policy for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>

    <p>
      The community directory is also a community project and you are welcome
      to get involved to help us make it even better or to integrate it into
      other community tools. Get in touch with us on the Mozillians forums
      (link) to learn how.
