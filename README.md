domesday
========

Mozilla's Domesday is a FLOSS tool that can be used by a community to create a directory of members, and allow them to connect with one another. It is named after the [Domesday Book][domesday-book], the first major survey of the members of a community, which was completed in the year 1086. It is based on [Playdoh][gh-playdoh], which is based on [Django][django].

Patches are welcome! Feel free to fork and contribute to this project on
[github][gh-domesday], but your efforts are more likely to be productive if you coordinate with Gerv (gerv@gerv.net) first. :-)
